Getting Started
===============

Try this once inside the 'src' directory:

    make
    cd examples
    ./run.sh

Requirements
------------

The above requires that you have g++ and R installed. And you'll need both the `gsl` and `grid` R libraries. I've only tried building the code on linux and Mac OS X. I distribute the code with Google Test, which I use as my unit test framework (similar to xUnit).
